		<h1>The Food We Eat </h1>
		<p> Do you ever feel tired after you eat certain foods? <br>
		Maybe it's after breakfast or your lunch 
		or just off of you snacking through out the day
		. That feeling you get that makes you feel
		unmotivated in things or makes simple tasks seem
		overwheling causing you to shut down.</p>
		<h1>Introducing Glucose spikes! </h1>
		
		<h2>First of all, what even is a glucose spike ?</h2>
		<img src="images/spikeGlucose.jpg" alt="Blood sugar chart" width= "400" height= "400">
		<p>Glucose is a sugar that plays a primary role in providing energy. Another way to say
		glucose spike, is sugar crash or sugar rush. That sugar gets broken down and goes direclty 
		into our blood streams! This is how our body gets energy. According to HealthLine, glucose 
		is a simple carbohydrate. In simple terms, a glucose spike is when your blood sugar is to high 
		which is called "Hyperglycemia"
		</p>
		
		<p>So what's the issue? Is it the foods we eat? 
		Is it the amound eaten? Is it the order of the foods we eat?
		maybe it's all of the above... Shall we continue?
