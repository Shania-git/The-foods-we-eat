		 <h1>Why do you feel this way? </h1>
		<p>As we know Sugary foods rush to the blood stream and causes glucose spikes and 
		one of the worse times to consume sugar is in the morning. In the morning our stomaatchs
		are empty; anything you consume with go directly into your blood stream!  
		Many foods and drinks will easily have our blood sugar over the top.</p>
		<h2>Breakfast meals such as:</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Fruit juices; even tho fruit is a natural sugar, it is still a sugar!</li>
			<li>Cereal like Cap'n Crunch and Mini Wheats; now this is a given. Cereal</li>
			<li>Pastries and baked goods ;</li>
			<li>Coffe drinks;</li>
		</ul> 
		

		<h2>Coffee</h2>
		<p>Believe it or not, coffee is also a factor of a sugar crash. Ultimately it is up to you
		to decide how much sugar is in your coffee, but it's not the sugar that causes these spikes. 
		Coffee can impact how your cells react to insulin (Liao) by damaging insulin sensitivity.
		People with type 2 diabetes have higher chance of a sugar crash. "One study looked at people 
		with type 2 diabetes who took a 250-milligram caffeine pill at breakfast and another at lunchtime...
		Their blood sugar was 8% higher than on days when they didn't have caffeine."</p>
