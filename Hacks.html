	<h1>Hacks! and ways to prevent a Glucose spike!</h1>
	<p>Fiber First!
	<br>When you consume fiber, you protect sugar from going directly into your
blood stream. The fiber slows down the amount of sugar that enters your body
and you won't experience such a big crash after eating loads of sugar.</br>

<h1>Start with a savory breakfast!</h1>
	<p>If you feel you aren't getting enough energy because your sugar levels are
	uncontrollable, have no fear. When you wake up, start your day with something savory, 
	save the sweets for later. Studies show that when you start your day off with a nutritious meal,
	you crave less sweets throughout the day (Ouellette)
